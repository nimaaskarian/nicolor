# Nicolor
Nicolor is a color manipulation library written in c++.
As I don't know how to name stuff, I just add **Ni** to it and call it a day.  

## What this actually is
This is just a recap of what I know from C/C++ and a farewell (not really, but I'll mostly try to code Rust from now on);
With learning unit tests and TDD in this beautiful language, and how to use CMake thanks to my friend [sepehr](https://https://github.com/Sephixum).

## I really don't know how to install
Since it uses CMake and I'm a CMake noob.
