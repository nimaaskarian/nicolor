# Nicolor
Nicolor is a color manipulation library and CLI tool written in C++.
As I don't know how to name stuff, I just add **Ni** to it and call it a day.  

## What this actually is
This is just a recap of what I know from C/C++ and a farewell (not really, but I'll mostly try to code Rust from now on);
With learning unit tests and TDD in this beautiful language, and how to use CMake thanks to my friend [sepehr](https://github.com/Sephixum).

## Installation
```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
```
